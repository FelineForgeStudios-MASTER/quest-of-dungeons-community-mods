# Quest of Dungeons Community Mod Collection
This a collection of different community made mods for the Steam version of the game Quest of Dungeons by David Amador. Feel free to add any of your own mods to the Repository!

# How to Apply them to your copy of the Game
Applying these mods are very easy, first, navigate to where Quest of Dungeons is installed on your PC, 
then open the folder and make a copy of the folder GameResources as a back-up incase something goes wrong.
Then, rename the folder of the mod you want to add from "GameResources - ModNameHere" to just "GameResources" and add it to the main Quest of Dungeons folder, then if your Operating System tells you that there is already files with the same name, just replace them.
Now when you load up the game you should see these changes applied.

# Rules to Uploading your own mod to the Collection
When uploading a mod to the collection make sure it follows these rules,
* 1, it does not contain any content from the orginal game, make sure it is all your own assets or mostly your own.
* 2, it does not contain other peoples content, if they didn't give you permission to use it then don't!!!
* 3, no NSFW items, more spefically items relating to "spicy" images or any erotic content.
